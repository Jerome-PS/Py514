# Py514
Python/Arudino control software for the Si514 USB interface.

This library is based on the previously published Py5351 library.

The python directory contains the python code to program the Si514.

The Arduino directory contains a sketch that when programamed into an
Adafruit trinket will turn it into a USB I2C interface.

For more information on the USB I2C interface, see
